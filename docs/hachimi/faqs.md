# FAQs

## How do I use another mod with Hachimi?

See the `load_libraries` option on the [Config page](/docs/hachimi/config). Note that some mods will not work with this method; they weren't really designed to be used with each other.

## The update just finished installing but everything's still not translated. Why?

The translations may have been installed, but the game hasn't attempted to load the new translations yet. Simply navigate to another screen (that triggers a loading procedure) and you should see translations appearing.

## Can I play the game while the update is in progress?

Yes, it is totally fine to continue playing the game while the translation data is still being updated, but do note that translations are disabled during update and will disappear when you navigate away from the current screen in the game. It should come back once it finishes installing and the game starts loading it (see above).

## I accidentally closed the game while it was installing. Is it over for me?

Nope. Just open the game back up again and it should ask you to start downloading from the beginning.

## What's that `.tl_repo_cache` file in my Hachimi folder? Can I eat it?

No. It's used to track the current state of the translation files for incremental updates later on; do not modify it manually or delete it.

## Is there a version or other mod for Apple devices (iOS)?

No. Apple devices are very tightly locked down, making it very difficult to create or install any mods of this nature.

## How do I uninstall Hachimi?

The installer has an uninstall option. If you no longer have it, you can download the latest one and use that.

## Will I get banned for using Hachimi? Have there been bans?

Hachimi and similar tools violate TOS. You always carry the risk.
It is however unlikely, and no bans relating to Hachimi or other translation tools have been reported since 2022.

## I think I'm banned, how can I tell for sure?

This is what the message should look like when you are banned:

## Can I play JP and Global simultaneously?
Yes, but you will need to use a workaround if using the DMM version. Check out [these steps](troubleshooting.md#error-501).

## What is the difference between the Physics Update Modes?
These are modes defined internally by the game, and not implemented by Hachimi. Little is known about them.
- `ModeNormal` is the default. 
- `Mode60FPS` seems to restore some physics movements when increasing framerate, but can still be a little buggy sometimes.
- Both `SkipFrame` modes are unknown but seem to be broken.
